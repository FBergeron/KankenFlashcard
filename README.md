# Kanken Flashcard Application

## Requirements

- Android

## Configuration

# Authentication

Before a user can start doing flashcard tests, he is required to authenticate himself using his Google account.  The application will use the user's email as a user identifier and store his personal data on the server.  To configure this, you will need to provide your own client_secret.json file.  For more information, consult Google's documentation.
