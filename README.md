# Kanken Flashcard Application

## Requirements

- Android

## Configuration

- Copy the file app/src/main/assets/config.json.sample as app/src/main/assets/config.json.
- Edit the app/src/main/assets/config.json file according to your environment.

- Make a directory at the same level of KankenFlashcard named keystore.
- Create a symbolic link named kanken.properties that points to your own keystore.properties. 
  For tests, it's ok to make kanken.properties points on ../KankenFlashcard/keystore.properties.sample.
